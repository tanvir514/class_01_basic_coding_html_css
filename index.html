	<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #444; margin: 17px 0px;">Hi everyone, this is Tanvir. Currently I'm living in Chittagong which is a great city to live in. I've recently completed my BSc from a private university of Chittagong. I have a passion for both <strong style="color: #000"><em> photography and traveling.</em></strong> Capturing the beauty through my lens is not just a hobby; it's a way for me to share the incredible moments and places I encounter on my journeys. I absolutely love doing these activities in my free time.<br> <br> I firmly believe in the power of honesty, ethics, and moral principles. Respect is another value that I hold dear. I deeply believe in valuing and treating others with respect, regardless of their backgrounds, cultures, or beliefs. Self-Improvement is an ongoing journey for me.  This has driven me to seek new challenges and opportunities for development. </p>
